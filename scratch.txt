Need for a camera system:
    Draws portion of large room from specified position
    Camera has fixed scale
    Camera follows player
    Camera area is bounded by room boundaries
    Camera transitions smoothly (ease) between focus points
    Camera can be controlled by room section properties
        room = entire loaded area
        e.g. arena area (a section of a room) can be
        bounded by different boundaries than the
        rest of the room
    
    Possible feature(s):
    Can focus multiple points/objects at once


    Room Section properties:
        Area to ignore until player enters
        Special boundary areas
        Lock-x/lock-y camera movement
